Running server.py will run the entire program
just like BookManager.py in the practice Labs of rlkee-flaskproject 
(to see rlkee-flaskproject you have to load Learning Programming in Coursera 
repository in Codespaces)

The index.html is run same as in BookManager

First ensure that machinetranslation package is importable by 
going to the final_project folder and in the terminal 
type python3 first to load python
then type import machinetranslation
If no error occurs, then it is importable

then make changes in the server.py for index.htmlk trigger function (renderIndexPage)
and to the two translate functions
merely calling french_to_english or english_to_french won't load these 
functions in server.py
This is because, the server.py is in the parent folder unlike the 
test.py which at the time of execution was in the same folder as translator.py

You have to call french_to_english as translator.french_to_english and 
english_to_french as translator.english_to_french
the import translator doesn't change it.

Finally, to run server.py, you have to load Python3 on terminal.
So the execution command of server.py on the terminal when you are in the 
final_project folder is will be:python3 server.py
